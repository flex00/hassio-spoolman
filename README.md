# Creating the storage directory

You'll need to execute the following in a HA console to create the storage directory. Sorry, I don't know how to do it automatically and all inquiries remained unanswered.

```
mkdir -p /config/addons_config/spoolman
chown 1000:1000 /config/addons_config/spoolman
```
